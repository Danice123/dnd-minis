# Flavius

Elf. Intelligent but unwise. At home more in the wilderness than civilization but has spent many years nearby and within Neverwinter. 

- Born/raised some elf place idk, nearby but rural
- Educated at the College of Color outside Neverwinter, since adolencence.- Focused on expanding his "color research" by traveling. Would be more tempted by a plant or stone of a unique color than gold/treasure, but also is practical not to ingore the necessessities.
- Bad decisions often strand him in obscure/rural areas but is not bothered by this

# College of Color

A rather misunderstood institution, devoted to the study and research of color's inate workings. Holds many eccentric views of how the world works. Much of this study is aided with heavy use of magic, especially the innately colorful kind.

- Going for a bit of a "college of flat earth" feel here, their actual studies and belliefs aren't correct but have been (mistakenly or not) heavily influenced by magic.

Magic focuses on Illusion primarly but potentially evocation for colorful effects.
